This is my 2020 FIP. 


## FIP THEME
Hi, this is the html/css assignment I did. The theme of this webpage is, my dream dessert store. My dream is that I can run a French dessert store to sell some French desserts and alcoholic drinks of my own design. I learned how to make webpage in this school. So I designed my French dessert store webpage in advance.

## THERE ARE THREE PAGES
There are three pages (actually there are four), the first one is index, which is the home page of this website. The second page is the drink page, which has some layouts and menus that I designed, and the wine and desserts are also made and photographed by me. The third page is the CONTACT page. During convid-19, I wanted customers to be able to buy through the website. This avoids contact and is more convenient at the same time.


## IMAGES
The pictures were taken by Canon 5d and iphone, post-produced with photoshop.
